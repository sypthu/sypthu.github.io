Abstract The new &amp;ldquo;Administrative Litigation Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Judicial Interpretation on Administrative Agreements&amp;rdquo; have expanded the jurisdiction of administrative litigation to encompass disputes over the effectiveness of administrative agreements, performance disputes, and disputes involving high authorities. They have also &amp;ldquo;relationship-orientedly&amp;rdquo; transformed the administrative agreement litigation system. When the People&amp;rsquo;s Court handles these disputes, it should move beyond the traditional logic of reviewing the legitimacy of administrative actions and allocate the rights and interests of all parties appropriately based on the overall legal relationship of administrative agreements.</description>
