Abstract Since the enactment of the new Administrative Litigation Law in 2015, judges in the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court&amp;rsquo;s administrative division have tended to expand the boundaries of administrative agreements by emphasizing the element of &amp;ldquo;administrative duties,&amp;rdquo; while judges in the civil division of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court have tended to restrict the boundaries based on the element of &amp;ldquo;administrative powers.&amp;rdquo; The source of this divergence lies in the inherent tension between the values of &amp;ldquo;safeguarding the public interest&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;respecting private rights&amp;rdquo; in China&amp;rsquo;s Constitution.</description>
