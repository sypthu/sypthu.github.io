Abstract An administrative agreement represents an initiative by the administrative authority to enter the market and seek cooperation with market entities. The parties involved can only reach an agreement on rights and obligations through equal negotiations, thereby establishing an administrative agreement relationship, which is fully consistent with civil contracts. The modern evolution of the foundations of public law and administrative law has also transformed the relationship between administrative authorities and counterparties from the traditional &amp;ldquo;command-obedience&amp;rdquo; model to a gradually emerging state of equality with dual legal status.</description>
