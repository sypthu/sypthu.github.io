Abstract How should the situation change and statutory termination system of civil contracts be referenced and applied to administrative agreements? Taking into account existing regulations and the judicial practices of people&amp;rsquo;s courts, it can be seen that when there is a fundamental breach of the agreement&amp;rsquo;s counterparty or it encounters force majeure and situation change, the contracting administrative entity should, in principle, refer to and apply the situation change and statutory termination system of civil contracts.</description>

Abstract An administrative agreement represents an initiative by the administrative authority to enter the market and seek cooperation with market entities. The parties involved can only reach an agreement on rights and obligations through equal negotiations, thereby establishing an administrative agreement relationship, which is fully consistent with civil contracts. The modern evolution of the foundations of public law and administrative law has also transformed the relationship between administrative authorities and counterparties from the traditional &amp;ldquo;command-obedience&amp;rdquo; model to a gradually emerging state of equality with dual legal status.</description>
