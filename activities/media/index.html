<p>Tianhao Chen states that Measures for Scientific and Technological Ethics Review (for Trial Implementation) has set up the organization and procedure for the review of scientific and technological ethics. He holds the view that the incentive logic of the institutions and the operational logic of the scientific and technological ethics (review) committees are contradictory, “one is the accelerator, and the other is the brake.” The current implementation of incentive alignment is achieved through punishment, which is relatively inefficient in the field of technological innovation. Tianhao Chen believes that certification mechanisms may be a good attempt to solve the problem, and reputation mechanisms could be embedded in the certification while linking the certification to the evaluation of the institutions.</p>
<p>Tianhao Chen mentions that Measures is a prerequisite for the establishment of mature scientific and technological ethics review work, but it is only a starting point. It is necessary to further refine the standards according to different scientific and technological fields. Mechanisms should also be established to meet the needs of technological development. In addition, he says that future attention should be paid to the public participation mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="hosting-the-29th-liberal-arts-salon-of-tsinghua-university-september-2023">Hosting the 29th liberal arts salon of Tsinghua University, September, 2023</h2>
<p>Tianhao Chen had a discussion with Yahua Wang, Tianfu Wang and Chaoyang Li in the salon over the topic of “rural revitalization from a multidisciplinary perspective”.</p>
<p>As the moderator of the salon, Tianhao Chen started the discussion with the importance of rural revitalization policies at the macro level. He pointed out that in addition to rural areas, there are also villages located on the outskirts of cities or in suburban areas, whose revitalization issues are also worth attention. In the following discussion, he invited the three guests to share their views of rural revitalization.</p>
<p>In the second part of the salon, Tianhao Chen invited the guests to delve into how rural governance can overcome the dilemma of collective action. In conclusion, he stated that the social relationship structure in rural areas is fundamentally different from that in cities. The process from the countryside to urban areas is a process of detachment, while the process of returning from the city to the rural areas involves the complex process of reintegrating into the existing relationship network of the countryside. In the face of this issue, digitalization such as the “online government” and “online village committees” can be seen as a potential solution. In addition, the villagers’ self-governance should be improved.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the salon, the guests discussed many specific issues, and expressed their expectations for the prospects of rural revitalization.</p>
<h2 id="interviewed-by-the-xinhua-news-agency-on-the-draft-of-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-on-penalties-for-administration-of-public-security-august-2023">Interviewed by the Xinhua News Agency on the draft of Law of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China on Penalties for Administration of Public Security, August, 2023</h2>
<p>The draft contains the regulations of light punishment and establishes the leniency system for confessions and punishments. Tianhao Chen believes that the new provisions provide incentives for offenders to resolve conflicts and correct illegal behavior, which is conductive to reducing the cost of law enforcement.</p>
